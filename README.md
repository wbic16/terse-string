# Terse String
The `trs::string` class provides a minimal wrapper for working with terse strings.

The sample program demonstrates how to read and write Terse files.

* You can display a nav tree by running `terse-string.exe <file>`.
* You can validate/parse an input file by running `terse-string.exe <file> <output>`.
